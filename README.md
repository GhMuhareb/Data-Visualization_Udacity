##Loan Data from Prosper 
##by Ghada Bin Muhareb   

##Dataset
This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount,  borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.  Since the dataset includes 81 variables it is difficult to invistigate all of them, so only few of them  will be explored. 

##Summary of Findings
* Most of the loans have a length of 36 months.
* Most of the borrowers have a rating of C and we can say most of them fall within the range D-A.
* Most of the borrowers are employed and most of those who are employed are full-time.
* There is a negative relationship between Prosper Rating of the borrowers and Borrower Anuual Percentage  Reate (APR), so the highest rating the borrower has the lowest Anuual Percentage Reate (APR)  the boorwoer will have.
* The Loan Original Amount has an impact on the Borrower Annual Percentage Rate (APR), in which increasing  Loan Original Amount will decrease Anuual Percentage Reate (APR).
* There is a relationship between Employment Status and Prosper Rating, in which most of the Prosper Rating  of borrowers are more likely to be Employed, since the Employed borrowers are the highest group.
* There is an obvious interaction between loan terms and ratings. As much as the Prosper ratings getting higher  or better, the loan original amount of all three loan terms getting increased, since the loan original amount  increased the term of loans also increases.
* Completed loans are the lowest Annual Percentage Rate (APR).  

##Key Insights for Presentation

* Higher prosper ratings of borrowers allow for larger loan original amount and longer term. 
* Lower prosper ratings lead to higher Annual Percentage Rate (APR).
